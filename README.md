# Huffman

Bored during Covid, so doing a Huffman encoding routine for fun (yes, I'm an interminable nerd).

## Notes

For me, creating the Huffman tree was much easier to reason about when using a Priority Queue.

## Improvements

Have been slowly optimising the code.

See [Benchmarks.md](https://github.com/stevehjohn/Huffman/blob/master/Benchmarks.md) for details of how various commits improved things.

See [Standardised-Benchmarks.md](https://github.com/stevehjohn/Huffman/blob/master/Standardised-Benchmarks.md) for results on a given hardware configuration.

Seems to pretty much hover around the 57% mark.

## Fun Observations

H. G. Wells closed all of his open brackets.
