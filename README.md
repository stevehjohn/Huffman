# Huffman

Bored during Covid, so doing a Huffman encoding routine for fun (yes, I'm an interminable nerd). Inspired by [Tom Scott's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8).

## Principle

Wikipedia explanation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

Essentially, you scan the text and count the number of occurrences of each character. Then, you create a tree where each leaf node is one of the characters. The tree is constructed in such a way that the most common characters are nearest the root node and the least common are furthest away.

You can then encode any character by using `0` and `1` to represent left or right in navigating the tree. In the simple example above, `w` is reached by going right, right, left, right or `1101`. So the character is encoded in only 4 bits rather than the usual 8 (or more).

## Notes

For me, creating the Huffman tree was much easier to reason about when using a Priority Queue.

## Improvements

Have been slowly optimising the code.

See [Benchmarks.md](https://github.com/stevehjohn/Huffman/blob/master/Benchmarks.md) for details of how various commits improved things. This uses the console app.

See [Benchmark-dotnet-Results.md](https://github.com/stevehjohn/Huffman/blob/master/Benchmark-dotnet-Results.md) for initial and current best results using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/).

Seems to pretty much hover around the 57% mark.

## Fun Observations

H. G. Wells closed all of his open brackets.
