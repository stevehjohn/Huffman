# Huffman

Bored during Covid, so doing a Huffman encoding routine for fun (yes, I'm an interminable nerd).

## Notes

For me, creating the Huffman tree was much easier to reason about when using a Priority Queue.

## Results

Downloaded some public domain novels from Project Gutenberg.

Here is the performance on my 2020 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz MacBook Pro.

Seems to pretty much hover around the 57% mark.
